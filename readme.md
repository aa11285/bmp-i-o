# bmp I/O
- Written in C
- Works with 8-bit grascale images or 24-bit RGB images
- Tested on Windows with C and C++

*It just blows my mind when it comes to the difficulty of all sorts of bmp I/Os that use global variables, or classes, or external libearies, or only work with color images... Then the last straw that broke me was when everything needed to be converted to C from C++... This is my own version of bitmap reading and writing, gathered and modified from all above sources, good enough for my needs in reading and writing grayscale or RGB images.*
